## Easy Whitelist Mod

Simple mod that changes whitelist behaviour from uuid-based to name-based, allowing it to be use at offline mode.

### Note
1) Command `easywhitelist add <nickname>` that adds offline uuid and nickname in whitelist
   - Vanilla `whitelist` in comparison adds lowercase nicknames
2) Name are case-**sensitive**
3) Elements in `whitelist.json` must still contain both name and uuid
   - uuids must be in correct format, but may be random

```
  {
    "uuid": "01234567-89ab-def0-1234-56789abcdef0",
    "name": "NikitaCartes"
  }
```
